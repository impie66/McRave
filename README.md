McRave is a simple AI that can A move with all three races. It has a small but refined set of builds that are capable of throwing games, as well as reactions to enemy builds and tech choices. It can also draw vast quantities of lines. The goal of McRave is to play as closely to the weak and inferior humans play, regardless of the AI meta, so that it may be prepared for the future when it can tilt the living shit out of human players and artosis.
